# Object-Oriented Programming in C++
Welcome to my Object-Oriented Programming in C++ repository! This repository contains a collection of assignments and problems related to OOPS in C++ that I have completed during my college coursework. Additionally, I have also included some general problems that may be asked in exams or papers related to OOPS in C++.

## Getting Started[]
To run any of the programs in this repository, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. I recommend using GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for compiling and running the programs.

To compile and run a program, navigate to its directory in the terminal and run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
./program_name
